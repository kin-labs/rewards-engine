# Contributing to the Kin Rewards Engine

Thank you for taking the time to contributing to the mission of building a better digital world, with developers, consumers, and content-creators at the center. 

## How To Contribute
Review this guide before submitting issues or requests.

Please use the improvement-proposals directory [(Improvement Proposals)](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals) to submit new proposed KRE iterations. Review this entire guide before submitting issues or requests.

Use the [improvement proposal template](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals/improvement-proposal-template.md) as a sample template to submit proposals to improve (i) the Kin Rewards Engine and its underlying mathematics & economics and (ii) the "Valid Spend Guidelines" which determine the definition of valid work in the Kin Ecosystem, which should be compensated in Kin.

Please follow these rules when suggesting improvements:

- Please open an issue if you want to discuss a topic mentioned in an improvement proposal
or just want to ask a question related to it.

- If you have a specific proposal, feel free to add a Pull Request with the
proposed changes to: [Improvement Proposals](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals).

- Discussion on this repo must relate to contents discussed in one of the improvement proposals.

- Please keep discussion civil.

Discussions not adhering to the following rules will be closed.

## Process 
Proposal submissions are reviewed by the Kin Foundation and accepted, denied, or modified at their own discretion. When a new proposal has been accepted for consideration, it will be merged into the improvement-proposals directory [(Improvement Proposals)](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals) and a window of time will be specified by the Kin Foundation for comments (via issues) and proposed changes (pull requests) to be reviewed. This process will iterate over time at the discretion of the Kin Foundation.
