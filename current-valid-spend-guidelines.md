# Valid KRE Spend Guidelines
### Key concepts
1. The user has control over the initiation of a transaction
2. The user is aware that a transaction is happening
### Terminology
- Valid spend - A spend that follows the guidelines; will be rewarded by the KRE
- User - A human being (consumer/creator) with a single wallet in the app
- Spend - A transaction between a user and developer (in-app/U-to-D)
- P2P - A transaction between two or more users
- Subscription - An automated payout distributed over a set period of time, regardless of usage
- Profile - A generic name for a handle that represents a user
### Usability guidelines
A transaction must be initiated by a user action, while the Kin logo must be visible on a button.
### Peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions
1. Only 1 Kin can be spent per tap (ie. like/heart/K)
- A single tap must communicate clearly to the user that a payment was made
- Users must have the ability to acknowledge and dismiss these communications
- Once acknowledged, there is no need to re-communicate with the user
2. In transactions of more than 1 Kin, the amount must be clearly stated on or near the action/button
3. Transactions of more than 1 Kin require a flow with a minimum of 2 clicks (undo/confirm/user input
amount/amount selection)
### User-to-developer (U-to-D) transactions
1. Every U-to-D experience, regardless of the amount transacted, must include the following:
- Clear messaging communicating the transaction amount
- Clear messaging telling the user what they will receive in return for their Kin 
- Must be a confirm/acknowledge button
### Subscription guidelines
A user can subscribe to an app (spend) or to a specific content creator (P2P). 
1. The day in which a subscription payment comes through will count as a daily active spender, but any passive payments that occur within the month will not count. 
2. Subscriptions must be initiated explicitly by the user
3. Transactions must be set to a fixed amount (from charge to charge)
4. Users must explicitly renew their subscription every X payments depending on the time period: Daily
(30), weekly (4), monthly (12), or yearly (1)
4. Before subscribing, the user must receive clear communication that includes:
- How much Kin will be charged in total
- Charging cadence and amount
- What the user receives as a subscriber
- A confirm/acknowledge button
- Information on how to unsubscribe
5. Users must be able to unsubscribe at any time
### Process handling for guidelines violation
If an app has an experience violating these guidelines:
1. App’s developer will be noticed about the violating experience
2. This app will be excluded from the KRE from the following payout
3. In order to be eligible again for KRE, there should be an updated app version in the App Store/Play
Store with the experienced fixed
### Transparency Clause
1. Only apps that are public known entities are eligible for KRE payouts. This benefits the ecosystem broadly by increasing discoverability of each of the apps and will also allow the community to hold each app accountable for adherence to the guidelines.
