# Rewarding for Depth of Kin Integration
Addendum to [NEA KRE 4 Proposal](/improvement-proposals/wg_kre_4.0.md)

Quality is a subjective term mostly determined by the user. This can be seen by the wide spectrum of UI/ UI observable online. Generally, a great app can mostly be distinguished from a regular app based on the amount of usage and number of users it has.

However, this does not address the _depth of integration_ of Kin into its ecosystem. Separating app quality from depth of implementation of Kin would allow the users to judge the quality of the app by 'voting with their feet' (NEA) while the Kin Foundation rewards apps with deep integration of Kin.

In order to factor integration depth, an app can be categorized into one of the following buckets, best on the depth of implementation:

1. Marginal: A user is unlikely to use Kin during everyday usage.
 The app may have items or services that a user can purchase that enhance the experience with Kin, but are not central to usage of the app. E.g. wallpapers
2. Incidental: A user will likely use Kin while using the app
 The user may periodically use Kin to enhance their service with the app. E.g. a weekly or monthly subscription
3. Central: Kin is central to the app's use where most of the activities are central to Kin. E.g. tipping or needing to buy items without which the app cannot function.

Note that this is geared towards usage and not simply receiving Kin from the developer.

Since every app that implements Kin contributes to the economy, apps should not be penalized for low integration. However, apps with deeper integration should be encouraged by having their NEI multiplied by a factor, based on the depth of integration. The following multiplication factors are recommended and can be adjusted by the Kin foundation.

1. Marginal: NEA x1
2. Incidental: NEA x 1.05
3. Central: NEA x 1.1

This allows for the Kin Foundation to reward apps that expend effort in deep integrations with Kin, while having as few constraints as possible. Since the level of integration is checked by the foundation, it can also ensure that integrations by apps are genuine and in good faith.


Compared to a proposal where apps have a list of elements to add (e.g. a tutorial or link to kin.org), this proposal ensures that apps going beyond 'surface-compliance' are recognized and rewarded.

## **Implementation**
This can be implemented together with the accepted version of the KRE 4, after giving apps time to understand/ negotate which implementation group they stand in.
